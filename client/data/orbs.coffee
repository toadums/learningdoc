          On top of that, the start-up I work at pushed public beta for our web-app on March 15th. This means that I had a collossal amount of work to do.
          It is easy to put school on the back-burner after being a broke student for so long. To avoid the tempation to work, I asked my boss for the last 3 weeks of the semester off. He happily granted me the time off."

          The only way that I was going to make it through the readings, especially 'Delete' for my book review, was to hole myself up in a coffeeshop or sushi resaraunt - with minimal distractions."
